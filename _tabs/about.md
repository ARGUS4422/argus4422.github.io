I am a passionate cybersecurity professional specializing in both Red Team and Blue Team operations. Trained extensively in offensive security techniques, I excel at identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities through realistic penetration testing and adversary simulation. At the same time, I am skilled in defensive strategies, including threat detection, incident response, and system hardening, to protect organizations against sophisticated cyber threats.

My comprehensive knowledge spans ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, network defense, and incident mitigation. I am committed to bridging the gap between offense and defense by understanding attacker methodologies and developing robust security controls. With a continuous learning mindset, I keep abreast of the latest cybersecurity trends and tools to safeguard digital assets effectively.
Ultimately, my goal is to help organizations anticipate, withstand, and recover from cyberattacks with resilience and confidence.
